"Antlers" Statamic syntax highlighting for Atom
=======================================================

This started as a weekend project to bring Statamic tag syntax highlighting to Sublime Text. I pulled a lot of the information for this from this ExpressionEngine bundle: https://github.com/fcgrx/ExpressionEngine2-Sublime-Text-3-Bundle and looking at this documentation: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html. In all honesty, I still don't understand why much of the syntax works. I was able to port the Sublime Text version over to Atom.

I called this Antlers because it was just fun... I mean, heck... everything about Statamic is fun.

To do
-----

I still need to add some stuff for the Raven and Bloodhound add-ons (http://statamic.com/add-ons). Statamic version 2 is on the way, and Raven and Bloodhound are now built-in, so the need for this may change.
